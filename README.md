# First run

You need Visual Studio and .NET 4.6.1.
Just press F5 to run the server. 
Use Tibia 8.6 client with an ip changer to connect to localhost on port 7171.
Use account number 1 and password 1.

# Notes

Please dont take this too seriously ;)
This project is really, really, really old.
It was abandoned on my computer and I found it recently.
It needs a lot of refactoring and architecting, but... it works for now, so, yey!
